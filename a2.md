## Objective

Study the impact of different scheduling algorithms on the average turnaround time of concurrent processes.

## Description

A simulation mimics the execution of $$n$$ different processes under different scheduling algorithms.

The simulation maintains a table that reflects the current state of the system:

{:.table .table-hover .table-striped .table-bordered .table-sm}
| Process | Active | Arrival Time | Total CPU Time | Remaining CPU Time | Turnaround Time
|---------|--------|--------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------- 	
| ...     |        |              |                |                    | 	
| $$p_i$$	| 0/1	   | $$A_i$$      | $$T_i$$        | $$R_i$$	          | $$TT_i$$
| ...     |        |              |                |                    | 	

The table is initialized as follows:

- The field "active" indicates whether the process is currently competing for the CPU.
  - The value becomes 1 at the time of process arrival and 0 at the time of process termination.
  - Initially, the value is set to 1 for all processes with arrival time $$A_i$$ = 0.
- Each $$A_i$$ is an integer chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between 0 and some value $$k$$, where $$k$$ is a simulation parameter.
- Each $$T_i$$ is an integer chosen randomly from a normal (Gaussian) distribution with an average $$d$$ and a standard deviation $$v$$, where $$d$$ and $$v$$ are simulation parameters.
- Each $$R_i$$ is initialized to $$T_i$$, since prior to execution, the remaining time is equal to the total CPU time required.

The simulation also maintains the current time, $$t$$, which is initialized to 0 and is incremented after each simulation step.

Each simulation step then consists of the following actions:

```
repeat until R_i == 0 for all n processes // repeat until all processes have terminated

    // if no process is ready to run, just advance t
    while no process is active, increment t

    choose active processes p_i to run next according to scheduling algorithm // Ex: FIFO, SJF, SRT
        update R_i & t // p_i has accumulated 1 CPU time unit

        if R_i == 0 // process i has terminated
            set active flag of p_i = 0 // process i is excluded from further consideration
            TT_i = t - A_i // the TT of process i is the time since arrival, TT_i, until the current time t

compute the average turnaround time, ATT, by averaging all values TT_i
```

## Assignment

- Implement the above simulation for the 3 scheduling algorithms, **FIFO**, **SJF**, **SRT**.
- Assume a value for $$k$$, which is the time interval during which processes may arrive. Ex: $$k$$ = 1000.
- Using a random number generator, derive $$n$$ arrival times, $$A_i$$, for all processes, each drawn from a uniform distribution within the interval $$[0 : k]$$.
- Choose an average total CPU time, $$d$$, and a standard deviation, $$v$$, and derive $$n$$ total CPU times, $$T_i$$, using a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
  - **NOTE:** all $$T_i$$ should be greater than 0. This effectively means that your Gaussian  distribution is a [rectified Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectified_Gaussian_distribution), which is fine.
- Repeat the simulation for different values of $$d$$ and $$v$$. (For simplicity, $$v$$ could be just be a fixed percentage of $$d$$.)
- The values $$d$$ and $$v$$ should be selected relative to $$k$$.
The value $$k$$/$$n$$ represents the frequency of process arrivals.
  - When $$d$$ is much smaller than $$k$$/$$n$$, then most processes run in isolation, without having to compete with other processes for the CPU.
  As a result, all scheduling algorithms should produce similar results.
  - On the other hand, when $$d$$ is much larger than $$k$$/$$n$$, then many processes will overlap in time and compete for the CPU.
  Consequently, different scheduling algorithms should yield different results.
- To compare the different algorithms, plot the values $$d / ATT$$ over $$d$$.
The value $$d / ATT = 1$$ shows how competition for CPU slows down the processes.
The smaller the value, the worse the overall performance.
The ideal case is $$d / ATT = 1$$, which indicates that all processes ran without any delays.
  - **NOTE:** You can use any plotting tool with which you are familiar (e.g., Excel, LIbreOffice, Jupyter, MATLAB).  
  I recommend writing out data needed for your plots to a CSV-formatted file, and loading it into your preferred plotting tool.

## Tips & Hints

1. To complete this assignment you need to be able to choose random numbers from statistical distributions.
   If you are brave *(or bored?)* you are welcome to code this yourself.
   I do, however, recommend the [GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) *([See the docs here](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/index.html))*,
   which should give you all the mathematical routines you should need *(and more...)*.  

   You can install GSL however you are most comfortable (e.g., on the GSL website they suggest FTP servers where GSL can be downloaded.)
   If on a linux machine, you should be able to simply run the following command to install GSL:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install gsl-bin libgsl0-dev
  ```
  If you are using GSL, you can use my provided [`gsl_example.c`]({{site.data.settings.code}}/gsl_example.c) to verify your install.

## What To Turn In & Instructions On Submitting your Assignment

Please submit all of your files for this assignment ***as a zipped folder to D2L***.

Your zipped folder should contains ***at least*** the following files:

1. The source code file(s) you've written for your solution.

2. A `Makefile` for compiling your program.

3. A `README.md` file (written in Markdown), which provides instructions on how to run your program, a summary of the program, and details about your approach to building your solution.

4. A `TESTING.md` file (written in Markdown), which provides a summary of how you validated the correctness of your solution.
For example, you should document your observations from running your program with various inputs.
A bash script that invokes your program with various inputs is recommended, but not required.
- **NOTE:** You should also submit sample output. This can be pasted into the `TESTING.md` file as appropriate, screenshots, etc.
