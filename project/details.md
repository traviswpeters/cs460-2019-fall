## Introduction

Students will complete an OS-related project in the final weeks of this term.
Students taking this course will be divide into groups of 2-4 people.
*(1-person teams are permissible, but groups of 2-4 people are preferable.)*
Each group will choose, propose, and implement an OS-related project; groups will also present a live demo and write a report about the project.
The evaluation of the project is based on the report, quality, presentation, and participation.
Each member of the same group should participate in the presentation/demo and will receive the same mark.

<!-- During the actual project presentations, attendance will be taken randomly. --- 3 points -->

## Project Details

Projects can take various forms:

1. **Technical Report (TR).** For this type of project, your group will work together to conduct a deep technical analysis of an existing OS concept and its implementation
(e.g., in the Linux OS). You should examine actual OS code and be able to describe how that code works.
You should also formally present an introduction to your OS concept/implementation,
why it is necessary,
alternative ideas or strategies,
an assessment of how it was implemented, and
ideas for future work or possible improvements.
2. **Proof of Concept (PoC).** For this type of project, your group will work together to implement an interesting OS idea or algorithm.
The primary assessment of this type of project will be through a short demo.
This project still requires a technical report, but the emphasis is less on the report and more on the demo.
3. **Something Else?** If your group has an idea that doesnâ€™t fit into one of the above categories, schedule some time to meet with me to discuss the idea.
Your group should come prepared to discuss details such as the problem, deliverables, assessment, and so forth.

## Project Milestones

#### Project Proposal

Your group will present a 1-page proposal on your project.

Your proposal should (briefly) address:

- A project title.
- Who are the members of your group.
- An overview to your proposed project and deliverables.
- A rough schedule for when various aspects of the project will be complete.
- Your plan for division of labor within the group.

#### Final Submission

Your group should submit all deliverables in a single zipped folder.

The naming convention should be:  

```
2019-fall-os-project-lastname1-lastname2-lastname3.zip
```

#### Final Presentation / Demo

All groups will present some form of presentation.
- TR projects will present an overview of their exploration and findings.
- PoC projects will present a demo (which should include some introduction to the project, the goals, and what the PoC demonstrates).
- Project presentations will take place in the final weeks of the term during regularly-scheduled class times.  
_**All presentations shall be no more than 10 minutes with 3-5 minutes of Q&A.**_{:.text-danger}
- All students are required to attend all of the projects presentations & demos.  
_**If you need to miss a class, I will need written notice at least 1 week before the class(es) that you will not be able to attend.**_{:.text-danger}
